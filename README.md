# Sprocket Feature
Heres my Onshape feature script to build a sprocket
(Designed for Single Roller Chain)
 
To use this feature after importing, use the handy "custom feature" tab and `Sprocket` Should pop out.

After selecting a `plane` to draw on, the feature will render with default parameters.

**All dimentions are based on [ANSI-Standard] 

<br>

If you zoom in you can see how the lines are formed in the gear. <br>
By connecting points that I've calculated using this [resource]. <br>
The points however are drawn in only one spot, <br>
then mirrored across the vertical axis, <br>
and finally rotated around the center for each tooth, <br>
resulting in a perfecly semetrical design.

In the corner of the page you will find another tab with another <br> 
demo sprocket I've made. In the next tab you will find <br>
the source code for this feature.
